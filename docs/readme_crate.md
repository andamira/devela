# devela

Devela is a growing development layer shaped by internal coherence, composability, and long-term clarity.<br/>
It treats code as a medium for modeling structure, meaning, execution, and lived human systems.<br/>
It is built in Rust, while remaining open to other paradigms, models, and tools.

The project evolves through exploration:
- Much of the library lives intentionally between sketch and consolidation.
- Some parts are mature and stable, while others are still emerging.
- Ideas are continuously refined, reshaped, and reconsidered.

It is…
```poetry
the soil I return to, where ideas take root and grow
friction dissolved, leaving only the working flow
a quiet dedication to learn, discover and share
where code and craft fuse to a circled square
```
