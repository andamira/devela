# devela

Devela is a growing development layer shaped by internal coherence and long-term clarity.<br/>
It treats code as a medium for modeling structure, meaning, execution and experience.<br/>
It is built in Rust, while remaining open to other tools, models and perspectives.

Much of the library lives somewhere in between sketch and consolidation.<br/>
Some parts are mature and stable while others are still emerging.<br/>
It is being continuously refined, reshaped, and rediscovered.

It is…
```poetry
the soil I return to, where ideas take root and grow
friction dissolved, leaving only the working flow
a quiet dedication to learn, discover and share
where code and craft fuse to a circled square
```
