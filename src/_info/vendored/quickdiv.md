This is derived work from the
[`quickdiv`](https://crates.io/crates/quickdiv/0.1.1) crate,
including the following modifications:

- unify all types in a single one with const-generic implementations.
- constructors return `Option` instead of panicking.
- specific implementations are feature-gated.
- misc. refactoring and code compression.
