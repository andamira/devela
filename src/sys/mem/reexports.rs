It is used as the underlying [`Storage`][super::Storage] for the [`Boxed`] marker
struct, just as a [`BareBox`][super::BareBox] is used as the storage for [`Bare`].

A special magic property of `Box` is that it allows moving with [*boxed], unlike
other `Deref` types. It is hoped that an eventual `DerefMove` trait will make it
possible for other types to opt in to move-from-deref.
