Devela is a growing development layer built around coherence rather than completeness.<br/>
It uses Rust as its foundation, while staying open to other paradigms and tools.

- The project evolves by exploration; ideas are always being refactored.
- Some parts are mature and stable; others are still taking shape.
- Most of the library lives between sketch and refinement.

```poetry
the soil I return to, where ideas take root and grow
friction dissolved, leaving only the working flow
a quiet dedication to learn, discover and share
where code and craft fuse to a circled square
```
