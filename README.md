Devela is a growing development layer shaped by internal coherence and long-term clarity.<br/>
It treats code as a medium for modeling structure, meaning, execution and experience.
It is built in Rust, while remaining open to other tools and perspectives.

Much of the library lives somewhere in between sketch and consolidation.<br/>
Some parts are mature and stable while others are still emerging.<br/>
It is being continuously refined, reshaped, and rediscovered.

It is…
```poetry
the soil I return to, where ideas take root and grow
friction dissolved, leaving only the working flow
a quiet dedication to learn, discover and share
where code and craft fuse to a circled square
```
