*A cohesive development layer*

> A lightweight, enduring foundation for multi-disciplinary development.


## Features

[Features] are grouped in 7 categories, mostly independent from each other,
so that they can be enabled orthogonally, and they're not fully additive,
e.g. it's not possible to enable at the same time `std` and `no_std`.
